## ⚠️ Disclaimer  
This report uses **dummy data** (*as of July 2025*) and is intended only to demonstrate Power BI capabilities.  
**No real business data is used.**

## 📈 Business Problem  
The previous reporting process relied on an **on-premises data warehouse**, which:  
- ❌ Lacked key data points for margin and performance analysis  
- 📂 Required pulling from multiple sources & manual Excel combination  

Business users faced challenges:  
- 📉 Manual KPI calculation  
- 🔄 Comparing actuals vs. forecasts across products & customers  
- 🧮 Running scenario tests directly in Excel  

This resulted in a **time-consuming and error-prone** process, taking **up to 10 working days** each month.

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- 🌐 Build a **cloud-based, centralised Power BI data model**  
- ⏱ Reduce reporting turnaround time from 10 days to **1–2 working days**  
- ✅ Improve **accuracy, speed, and trust** in the data  
- 📊 Create a **dynamic dashboard** to analyse & optimise gross margin performance  
- 💡 Enable **proactive pricing decisions** through scenario testing  

**Key Deliverables:**  
- Track gross margin by customer segment & product category  
- Compare actuals vs. forecasts to evaluate performance  
- Highlight insights through KPIs  

---

## 👥 Key Stakeholders  
**Finance Team**  
- 📌 Needed visibility into margin performance & cost/revenue drivers  
- 🧪 Required pricing scenario simulations for strategic decision-making  

**Executive Management Directors**  
- 📌 Needed high-level performance overviews  
- 🧪 Required scenario testing for pricing impact on revenue, cost, and margin

## 🤝 Collaboration Approach  

### 🔍 Initial Requirements Gathering  
- Conducted **stakeholder workshops** with Finance to clarify needs  
- Reviewed existing reports to identify **data gaps & inefficiencies**  
- Documented **KPIs, data definitions, and calculations** in a central sheet  
- Prioritised requirements & validated with Finance before development  

### 🔄 Ongoing Collaboration & Support  
- Regular **3x/week catch-ups** with Finance to refine requirements & resolve data issues  
- Clear role definitions for **streamlined communication**  
- Issues logged in **Azure DevOps** and escalated to Data Engineering for fixes  
- Participated in **daily engineering standups** to align on priorities
